I had the same problem and "solved" it but with a suboptimal solution:

Directly (!) in GraphAware\Common\Driver\SessionInterface, I tried to replace

public function run($statement, array $parameters = Array, $tag = NULL);

by

public function run($statement, $parameters = array(), $tag = null);

which seems to be what is expected by Graphaware\Neo4j\Client\HttpDriver\Session

And it works... for now (until package update?)

Could that be a bug?
